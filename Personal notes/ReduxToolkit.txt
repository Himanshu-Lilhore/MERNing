Redux toolkit

 Basic ugly todo app implementation



ðŸ§µ(2/5)
Redux comes in handy to have a global state in apps instead of having to pass values down the components using props.

Redux toolkit is an improvement on Redux. react-redux is react implementation of that library, we use both in our app to use redux toolkit.

// src/app/store.js
First of all we create a store, which stores all the data in the single place.

We pass an object to configure store method containing all states.

Reduces key takes an object (listing states for all the features) or just a single state too.

// src/features/todo/todoSlice.js
Slice contains properties and reducers for a state
createSlice initializes it with an obj

Reducers have :
state- latest state
action- parameters on function call

Export reducers (for components) & state (to make main store aware of it)

// src/components/AddTodo.jsx
useDispatch is uses reducers to save values into the store.

// scr/components/ViewTodo.jsx
useSelector is used to view store values (often specific states are stores locally instead of whole store)
